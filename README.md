# ragsc

## description

This is a proof of concept project to develop a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) database for cell annontation.  The goal is to 
explore the usefulness of RAG as a way to facilitate the use of large language models for single cell RNA seq work.

## approach

The goal is to develop a vector database using Postgresql and pgvector.  By using Postgresql, we potentially gain the ability to 
supplement vector similarity with traditional SQL database functions.
