# Roadmap

## convert the project to Conda to be able to use R properly in notebooks (20240514)

- in accordance with [Single Cell Best Practices](https://www.sc-best-practices.org/preamble.html),
need to be able to accommodate workflows in both R and Python
- it is important to explore Bioconductor workflows as well as Seurat
- it is also recommended that single cell analysis be done in notebooks rather than in pipelines
because of the need to tune parameters interactively

## next steps (20240514)

1. Follow the tutorial in the Single Cell Best Practices site
2. Test out the different methods of automatic annotation
3. Consider how RAG might enhance those methods
4. Explore alternative clustering algorithms making use of scvi-tools and SnapATAC2
